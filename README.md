DejaVideo lives in your menu bar. It allows you to record your screen continuously and to export the last minute at any moment.

* With a minimum impact on your Mac, you can let it record always.
* Supports both dark and light mode
* 100% offline (No phoning home, no analytics, no update mechanisms)
* Opens the screen recording in QuickTime upong exporting. Hit <code>‚åò T</code> and trim it to your needs.
* Has a fancy loading animation to indicate which screen is being recorded

This code was my first stab at using Swift. It's source is now public, because.. why not?

## üî® Development Tips

### Summary of the main logic

The [ContinuousRecording](https://github.com/jasperhartong/DejaVideo/blob/readme-update/ContinuousRecorder/Models/ContinuousRecorder.swift#L152) state-machine aggregates a list of [ScaledRecordingFragments](https://github.com/jasperhartong/DejaVideo/blob/readme-update/ContinuousRecorder/Models/ContinuousRecorder.swift#L67) (storing the current screen image and mousePoint position), based on the firing of a [RepeatingBackgroundTimer](https://github.com/jasperhartong/DejaVideo/blob/readme-update/ContinuousRecorder/Utils/RepeatingBackgroundTimer.swift). When exporting to video, the [VidWriter](https://github.com/jasperhartong/DejaVideo/blob/readme-update/ContinuousRecorder/Utils/VidWriter.swift) merges these fragments using CVPixelBuffer.

### Running the project

Open up the .xcodeproj, run and DejaVideo should appear in your menu bar.

### Packing the release in a dmg

- Build a release
- Use https://github.com/sindresorhus/create-dmg

### Test starting at login

In order to let this work during development, there should be only 1 app found for the bundle identifier of the LauncherApplication.

To check whether MacOs finds ONLY the correct build (which should be /Applications):

```
import Cocoa

let bundleId = "deblonde.LauncherApplication"
let paths = LSCopyApplicationURLsForBundleIdentifier(bundleId as CFString, nil)
print("Available service instances by bundle id: \(String(describing: paths))")
```

To remove builds:
- make sure to clean the project (`‚åò + Shift + alt + K`).
- make sure to clean the archives (`‚åò + Shift + 6`)

Also, it could help to bump the build number in the General options of the project

#### Launchctl

In the end `deblonde.LauncherApplication` should be registered in launchctl, you can check or interact with it:

```
$launchctl list
$launchctl remove deblonde.LauncherApplication
```
